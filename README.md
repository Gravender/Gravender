## Hello

I am a software engineer with a passion for rock climbing, problem solving, and the great outdoors. My technical skills and love for collaboration enable me to tackle complex challenges. In my free time, I enjoy climbing and exploring the outdoors. I am always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow as a software engineer. Feel free to reach out if you think I could be a good fit for your project or team."
